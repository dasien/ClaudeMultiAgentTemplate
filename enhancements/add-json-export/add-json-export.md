# Enhancement: Add JSON Export Feature

**Status**: Example Enhancement
**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Feature Addition

## Overview

Add the ability to export tasks to JSON format for backup, sharing, and integration with other tools.

## User Story

As a task manager user, I want to export my tasks to JSON format, so that I can backup my data, share it with others, or import it into other tools.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Export all tasks (including completed) to JSON format
2. Command-line interface for export functionality
3. Specify output file path
4. Proper JSON structure with all task data
5. Handle empty task lists gracefully

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Export should be fast (< 1 second for typical task lists)
- JSON should be properly formatted and readable
- Handle file write errors gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing storage

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can export tasks using `python src/task_manager.py export tasks.json`
- [ ] Exported JSON contains all task data (id, title, description, status, timestamps)
- [ ] JSON is properly formatted and valid
- [ ] Export works with empty task list
- [ ] Export handles file write errors gracefully
- [ ] Existing functionality is not affected

## Technical Considerations

- Python's built-in `json` module should be sufficient
- Consider JSON structure: array of task objects vs. structured format
- File path validation and error handling
- Integration with existing TaskManager class
- CLI argument parsing for export command

## Out of Scope

- JSON import functionality (future enhancement)
- Export filtering (specific tasks or date ranges)
- Export to other formats (CSV, XML, etc.)
- Automatic periodic backups

## Dependencies

- None (uses Python standard library)

## Risks

- Low - straightforward feature with minimal complexity

## Notes for Requirements Analyst

**Analysis Tasks**:
1. Review and clarify the requirements above
2. Identify any ambiguities or missing requirements
3. Create high-level implementation phases
4. Define success criteria and validation approach
5. Flag any technical concerns for architect

**Questions to Consider**:
- Should export include only active tasks or all tasks?
- What should happen if export file already exists?
- Should there be any data validation before export?

---

## Notes for Architect

**Architecture Tasks**:
1. Design JSON structure format
2. Design TaskManager.export_to_json() method signature
3. Plan CLI integration for export command
4. Design error handling strategy
5. Document file I/O approach

**Design Considerations**:
- JSON structure should be extensible for future import
- Consider using Task.to_dict() for serialization
- File operations should be atomic where possible
- Error messages should be user-friendly

---

## Notes for Implementer

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. Add `export` subcommand to argument parser
2. Implement `TaskManager.export_to_json(filename)` method
3. Use Task.to_dict() for serialization
4. Add appropriate error handling and validation
5. Update help text for new command

**Implementation Guidance**:
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Use context managers for file operations
- Add docstrings to new methods
- Preserve existing functionality

---

## Notes for Tester

**Testing Tasks**:
1. Write unit tests for export_to_json() method
2. Test with empty task list
3. Test with populated task list
4. Test error conditions (invalid path, permission errors)
5. Validate JSON structure and content
6. Integration test with CLI command

**Test Scenarios**:
- Export with no tasks
- Export with multiple tasks (active and completed)
- Export to existing file (should overwrite)
- Export to invalid path
- Export with file permission errors
- Validate JSON format and completeness

---

## Notes for Documenter

**Documentation Tasks**:
1. Add export command to PROJECT_README.md
2. Provide usage examples
3. Document JSON format structure
4. Add troubleshooting section
5. Update feature list

**Documentation Sections**:
- Command usage and options
- Example JSON output
- Common issues and solutions
- Related features (future import)

## Example JSON Output

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "description": "Milk, eggs, bread",
    "status": "pending",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    "completed_at": null
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Finish report",
    "description": "Q4 financial report",
    "status": "completed",
    "created_at": "2024-01-14T09:00:00",
    "completed_at": "2024-01-15T16:45:00"
  }
]
```

## Timeline Estimate

- **Requirements Analysis**: 30 minutes
- **Architecture Design**: 1 hour
- **Implementation**: 2 hours
- **Testing**: 1.5 hours
- **Documentation**: 1 hour

**Total**: ~6 hours

This enhancement demonstrates a complete workflow from requirements through implementation, testing, and documentation.
