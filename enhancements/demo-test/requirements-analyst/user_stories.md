# User Stories: Demo Test Enhancement

## Story Overview

This document contains user stories for the demo-test enhancement. Given the simplicity of this test enhancement, there is primarily one main user story with clear acceptance criteria.

---

## Story 1: Execute Hello Command

**Story ID**: US-1
**Epic**: Demo Test Enhancement
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: Small (1 story point)

### Story Statement

```
As a developer testing the multi-agent workflow system,
I want to run a simple "hello" command,
So that I can verify the workflow processes commands correctly without complex implementation.
```

### Context

The multi-agent workflow system needs to be tested end-to-end to ensure all phases (requirements analysis, architecture, implementation, testing, documentation) work correctly. A simple command that prints "Hello, World!" provides the minimal test case to verify the system without introducing implementation complexity that could mask workflow issues.

### User Persona

**Role**: Developer / QA Engineer
**Goal**: Validate multi-agent workflow system
**Technical Level**: High (comfortable with CLI and Python)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC-1: Command Execution
- [ ] **Given** the task manager CLI is available
- [ ] **When** I run `python src/task_manager.py hello`
- [ ] **Then** the command executes without errors (exit code 0)

#### AC-2: Output Verification
- [ ] **Given** the hello command is executed
- [ ] **When** I capture the stdout
- [ ] **Then** the output is exactly "Hello, World!" (with newline)
- [ ] **And** no additional text is printed
- [ ] **And** no error messages appear on stderr

#### AC-3: Help Menu Integration
- [ ] **Given** the task manager CLI help system
- [ ] **When** I run `python src/task_manager.py --help`
- [ ] **Then** the hello command appears in the command list
- [ ] **And** it has a descriptive help message

#### AC-4: No Arguments Required
- [ ] **Given** the hello command specification
- [ ] **When** I invoke the command
- [ ] **Then** no positional arguments are required
- [ ] **And** no optional flags are required
- [ ] **And** the command runs with just `hello` as the subcommand

#### AC-5: Pattern Consistency
- [ ] **Given** existing CLI commands (add, list, complete, delete, show)
- [ ] **When** I examine the hello command implementation
- [ ] **Then** it follows the same argparse subparser pattern
- [ ] **And** it follows the same command handler pattern in main()
- [ ] **And** it uses consistent code style and formatting

#### AC-6: No Breaking Changes
- [ ] **Given** all existing commands
- [ ] **When** the hello command is added
- [ ] **Then** all existing commands continue to work correctly
- [ ] **And** no existing functionality is modified
- [ ] **And** no existing tests fail

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented in src/task_manager.py
- [ ] Command executes successfully with correct output
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All agents completed their workflow phases

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing**:
```bash
# Test 1: Basic execution
$ python src/task_manager.py hello
Expected: Hello, World!

# Test 2: Exit code verification
$ python src/task_manager.py hello
$ echo $?
Expected: 0

# Test 3: Help menu
$ python src/task_manager.py --help
Expected: hello command appears in list

# Test 4: Command help
$ python src/task_manager.py hello --help
Expected: help text for hello command

# Test 5: No arguments
$ python src/task_manager.py hello extra_arg
Expected: Should either ignore or error (to be decided by architect)
```

**Automated Testing**:
```python
# Test case: hello command output
def test_hello_command():
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['python', 'src/task_manager.py', 'hello'],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    assert result.returncode == 0
    assert result.stdout == "Hello, World!\n"
    assert result.stderr == ""
```

### Dependencies

**Depends On**:
- Existing argparse setup in main() function
- Existing task_manager.py file structure

**No External Dependencies**: This story requires no new libraries or external systems.

### Technical Notes

**Implementation Location**: src/task_manager.py

**Estimated Changes**:
- Add ~5 lines for subparser definition
- Add ~3 lines for command handler
- Total: ~8-10 lines of code

**Risk Assessment**: Very low risk
- Additive change only
- No modification to existing code paths
- Simple print statement with no complex logic

### Business Value

**Value to Project**: High
- Validates multi-agent workflow system end-to-end
- Provides baseline for future workflow testing
- Ensures all agents can process simple requirements

**Value to Users**: Low (this is a test command)
- Not intended for end-user use
- May be removed after workflow validation

## Story 2: Workflow Validation (Meta-Story)

**Story ID**: US-2
**Epic**: Multi-Agent Workflow Testing
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: N/A (depends on US-1)

### Story Statement

```
As a system architect,
I want to verify all workflow agents complete successfully for a simple enhancement,
So that I can trust the workflow system for more complex features.
```

### Context

This is a meta-story that encompasses the entire workflow process, not just the implementation. The "hello" command serves as the vehicle for testing the workflow system itself.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC-1: Requirements Analysis Phase
- [ ] **Given** the demo-test enhancement specification
- [ ] **When** the requirements-analyst agent processes the document
- [ ] **Then** analysis_summary.md is created
- [ ] **And** requirements are clearly documented
- [ ] **And** status is READY_FOR_DEVELOPMENT

#### AC-2: Architecture Phase
- [ ] **Given** the requirements analysis output
- [ ] **When** the architect agent processes the requirements
- [ ] **Then** architectural design documents are created
- [ ] **And** implementation approach is specified
- [ ] **And** status is READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION

#### AC-3: Implementation Phase
- [ ] **Given** the architectural design
- [ ] **When** the implementer agent processes the design
- [ ] **Then** code is written to src/task_manager.py
- [ ] **And** implementation matches specifications
- [ ] **And** status is READY_FOR_TESTING

#### AC-4: Testing Phase
- [ ] **Given** the implementation
- [ ] **When** the tester agent processes the code
- [ ] **Then** test cases are created
- [ ] **And** tests are executed and pass
- [ ] **And** status is READY_FOR_DOCUMENTATION

#### AC-5: Documentation Phase
- [ ] **Given** the completed implementation
- [ ] **When** the documenter agent processes the feature
- [ ] **Then** documentation is created or updated
- [ ] **And** status is COMPLETED

#### AC-6: Agent Subdirectories
- [ ] **Given** each agent execution
- [ ] **When** an agent completes its work
- [ ] **Then** a subdirectory is created in enhancements/demo-test/
- [ ] **And** all agent outputs are stored in their subdirectory
- [ ] **And** log files include start and end markers

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All 5 workflow phases complete successfully
- [ ] All agent subdirectories created with correct structure
- [ ] All agent outputs include required metadata headers
- [ ] Log files are complete and properly formatted
- [ ] Final implementation works as specified
- [ ] Workflow can be used as template for future enhancements

### Success Metrics

1. **Workflow Completion**: All agents complete without errors
2. **Timing**: End-to-end workflow completes in < 30 minutes
3. **Output Quality**: All documents are well-structured and complete
4. **Code Quality**: Implementation is clean and follows standards
5. **Test Coverage**: Tests are comprehensive and all pass

## Story Backlog (Future Enhancements - Out of Scope)

The following stories are identified but explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this enhancement:

### Future Story: Parameterized Hello
```
As a user,
I want to customize the hello command with a name argument,
So that I can see personalized greetings.
```
**Reason for Deferral**: Adds complexity not needed for workflow testing

### Future Story: Multiple Output Formats
```
As a user,
I want to choose different output formats (plain, JSON, etc.),
So that I can integrate with other tools.
```
**Reason for Deferral**: Over-engineering for a test command

### Future Story: Internationalization
```
As a non-English user,
I want to see greetings in my language,
So that I can use the tool in my native language.
```
**Reason for Deferral**: Unnecessary for test command purpose

## Notes for Implementation Team

### Implementation Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Implement the absolute minimum first, then verify
2. **Follow Patterns**: Copy the structure of existing commands exactly
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test after each small change
4. **No Over-Engineering**: Resist the urge to add extra features

### Code Placement Recommendation

```python
# Around line 166 in src/task_manager.py, add:
hello_parser = subparsers.add_parser("hello", help="Print Hello, World! (test command)")

# Around line 216 in main() function, add:
elif args.command == "hello":
    print("Hello, World!")
```

This placement recommendation will be refined by the architect agent.

### Testing Approach

Start with manual testing, then add automated tests:
1. Manual: Run command and verify output visually
2. Shell script: Automated output comparison
3. Python test: subprocess-based integration test
4. Unit test: If appropriate (may not be necessary for this simple command)
