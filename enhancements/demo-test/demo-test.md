# Enhancement: Demo Test Enhancement

## Purpose
This is a minimal test enhancement to verify the multi-agent workflow system is functioning correctly.

## Objective
Create a simple "Hello World" style feature that allows testing of the agent workflow without generating large amounts of output.

## Requirements
- Add a new `hello` command to the task manager
- The command should print "Hello, World!" to the console
- No arguments needed
- Should be simple to implement and test

## Success Criteria
- Command executes without errors
- Prints expected output
- All agents complete their phases successfully

## Expected Output
```
$ python src/task_manager.py hello
Hello, World!
```

## Notes
This is a test enhancement to verify:
1. Requirements analysis works
2. Architecture design works
3. Implementation works
4. Testing works
5. Documentation works
6. Agent subdirectories are created correctly
7. Log files are complete with start and end markers
