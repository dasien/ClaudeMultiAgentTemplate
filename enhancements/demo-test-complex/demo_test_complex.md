Enhancement: Demo Test Complex - Export to JSON

Status: Example Enhancement Priority: Medium Type: Feature Addition
Overview

Add the ability to export tasks to JSON format for backup, sharing, and integration with other tools.
User Story

As a task manager user, I want to export my tasks to JSON format, so that I can backup my data, share it with others, or import it into other tools.
Requirements
Functional Requirements

    Export all tasks (including completed) to JSON format
    Command-line interface for export functionality
    Specify output file path
    Proper JSON structure with all task data
    Handle empty task lists gracefully

Non-Functional Requirements

    Export should be fast (< 1 second for typical task lists)
    JSON should be properly formatted and readable
    Handle file write errors gracefully
    Maintain backward compatibility with existing storage

Acceptance Criteria

    User can export tasks using python src/task_manager.py export tasks.json
    Exported JSON contains all task data (id, title, description, status, timestamps)
    JSON is properly formatted and valid
    Export works with empty task list
    Export handles file write errors gracefully
    Existing functionality is not affected

Technical Considerations

    Python's built-in json module should be sufficient
    Consider JSON structure: array of task objects vs. structured format
    File path validation and error handling
    Integration with existing TaskManager class
    CLI argument parsing for export command

Out of Scope

    JSON import functionality (future enhancement)
    Export filtering (specific tasks or date ranges)
    Export to other formats (CSV, XML, etc.)
    Automatic periodic backups

Dependencies

    None (uses Python standard library)

Risks

    Low - straightforward feature with minimal complexity

Notes for Requirements Analyst

Analysis Tasks:

    Review and clarify the requirements above
    Identify any ambiguities or missing requirements
    Create high-level implementation phases
    Define success criteria and validation approach
    Flag any technical concerns for architect

Questions to Consider:

    Should export include only active tasks or all tasks?
    What should happen if export file already exists?
    Should there be any data validation before export?

Notes for Architect

Architecture Tasks:

    Design JSON structure format
    Design TaskManager.export_to_json() method signature
    Plan CLI integration for export command
    Design error handling strategy
    Document file I/O approach

Design Considerations:

    JSON structure should be extensible for future import
    Consider using Task.to_dict() for serialization
    File operations should be atomic where possible
    Error messages should be user-friendly

Notes for Implementer

Implementation Tasks:

    Add export subcommand to argument parser
    Implement TaskManager.export_to_json(filename) method
    Use Task.to_dict() for serialization
    Add appropriate error handling and validation
    Update help text for new command

Implementation Guidance:

    Follow existing code style and conventions
    Use context managers for file operations
    Add docstrings to new methods
    Preserve existing functionality

Notes for Tester

Testing Tasks:

    Write unit tests for export_to_json() method
    Test with empty task list
    Test with populated task list
    Test error conditions (invalid path, permission errors)
    Validate JSON structure and content
    Integration test with CLI command

Test Scenarios:

    Export with no tasks
    Export with multiple tasks (active and completed)
    Export to existing file (should overwrite)
    Export to invalid path
    Export with file permission errors
    Validate JSON format and completeness

Notes for Documenter

Documentation Tasks:

    Add export command to PROJECT_README.md
    Provide usage examples
    Document JSON format structure
    Add troubleshooting section
    Update feature list

Documentation Sections:

    Command usage and options
    Example JSON output
    Common issues and solutions
    Related features (future import)

Example JSON Output

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "description": "Milk, eggs, bread",
    "status": "pending",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    "completed_at": null
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Finish report",
    "description": "Q4 financial report",
    "status": "completed",
    "created_at": "2024-01-14T09:00:00",
    "completed_at": "2024-01-15T16:45:00"
  }
]

Timeline Estimate

    Requirements Analysis: 30 minutes
    Architecture Design: 1 hour
    Implementation: 2 hours
    Testing: 1.5 hours
    Documentation: 1 hour

Total: ~6 hours

This enhancement demonstrates a complete workflow from requirements through implementation, testing, and documentation.
