# Enhancements

This directory contains enhancement requests and feature proposals for the project.

## Structure

Each enhancement should be in its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
enhancements/
└── enhancement-name/
    ├── enhancement-name.md       # Enhancement specification
    ├── requirements.md           # Requirements analysis (from analyst)
    ├── architecture.md           # Architecture design (from architect)
    ├── implementation-notes.md   # Implementation notes (from implementer)
    ├── test-results.md          # Testing results (from tester)
    ├── documentation.md          # Documentation updates (from documenter)
    └── logs/                    # Agent execution logs
```

## Enhancement Template

Each enhancement should include:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the enhancement
2. **User Story**: User-focused description of the need
3. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success criteria
5. **Technical Considerations**: High-level technical concerns
6. **Out of Scope**: What this enhancement does NOT include
7. **Agent Notes**: Specific guidance for each agent role

## Workflow

Enhancements typically flow through these phases:

1. **Requirements Analysis** (Requirements Analyst)
   - Clarify and document requirements
   - Create implementation plan
   - Output: `requirements.md`

2. **Architecture Design** (Architect)
   - Design technical solution
   - Make technology choices
   - Output: `architecture.md`

3. **Implementation** (Implementer)
   - Write production code
   - Follow architectural design
   - Output: Code changes + `implementation-notes.md`

4. **Testing** (Tester)
   - Validate functionality
   - Write test suite
   - Output: Test code + `test-results.md`

5. **Documentation** (Documenter)
   - Update user documentation
   - Document APIs
   - Output: Doc updates + `documentation.md`

## Status Markers

Enhancements use these status markers:

- `READY_FOR_DEVELOPMENT` - Requirements complete, ready for architecture
- `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` - Architecture complete, ready to code
- `READY_FOR_TESTING` - Implementation complete, ready to test
- `TESTING_COMPLETE` - Testing complete, ready for documentation
- `DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE` - Enhancement complete

## Example Enhancement

See `add-json-export/` for a complete example enhancement that demonstrates the full workflow.

## Creating a New Enhancement

1. Create a new subdirectory with a descriptive name
2. Copy the enhancement template or use `add-json-export.md` as reference
3. Fill in all sections, especially agent-specific notes
4. Start with Requirements Analyst agent

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Clearly define what the enhancement should do
- **Include Examples**: Provide concrete examples of expected behavior
- **Set Scope**: Clearly define what's in and out of scope
- **Agent Guidance**: Provide specific guidance for each agent role
- **Track Progress**: Use status markers to track workflow progress
